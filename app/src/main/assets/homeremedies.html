                <p>What is a Home Remedy
                    <p>A home remedy is a treatment to cure a disease or ailment that employs certain spices, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have medicinal properties that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons. A common error is to confuse home remedies with <a title="Homeopathy: General Healing Information" href="/medical/alternative/homeopathy/">homeopathic remedies</a>. In fact, the two concepts are unrelated.
                        <p>A Home remedy is defined as a simply prepared medication or tonic often of unproven effectiveness administered without prescription or professional supervision. Home remedies may or may not have medicinal properties that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question. Every civilization defines, views and applies its home remedies differently.

                            <p>Home remedies have become increasingly popular as the expense and hassle of conventional medicine continues to rise. Beyond the convenience, home remedies have found favor with a public that wants to take a more holistic approach to its ailments.
                                <p>Today herbs are catching a lot of attention due to their very nature of cure: simple, no side effects, no chemicals, inexpensive, plus the ability of being able to cure yourself. This trend for resorting to home remedies is not new. In fact, they have their origin in ancient times. Traditionally, in India, <a title="Herbalism: Herbs &amp; Herbal Medicine Cures" href="/medical/alternative/herbal/">plants with medicinal value</a>, were grown in home gardens. These plants were used effectively as self help remedies for managing primary health care.
                                    <p>More and more today it seems modern science is only working to herd us into our local doctors office and load us up with expensive prescriptions drugs.
                                        <p>Natural remedies can be used to efficiently treat a range of ailments through correct and regular usage. Whether it is to boost your child's immune system, preventing avoiding hair loss, treating persistent acne or dandruff, treating aches, pains or cuts and burns.
                                            <p>The medicament present in many home remedies is in the form of alkaloids, essential oils, enzymes, trace elements and minerals. Once absorbed they are assimilated only in the quantity needed by the human body.
                                                <p>One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of chicken soup to treat respiratory infections such as a cold or mild flu, and according to recent studies, this may actually be effective.

                                                        <p>Other examples of medically successful home remedies include willow bark tea to cure headaches and fevers (willow bark contains a form of acetylsalicylic acid, also known as aspirin); duct tape to help with setting broken bones; and duct tape or super-glue to treat plantar warts; and Kogel mogel to treat sore throat.
